# Tesseract

Tesseract is a web app allowing users to practice for competitions in the [MAA AMC](https://maa.org/student-programs/amc/) series online. Specifically, it supports practicing past AMC 10, AMC 12, and AIME contests right in the browser. Tesseract also has user authentication built in, so users can save practice exam results to their account and access their scores and answer choices any time later.

Tesseract is built with Tailwind CSS and Firebase, and is deployed using GitHub Pages.
